<h2>She is the slayer.</h2>

  <p>May 9th, 2014</p>

  <p>The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with demons. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. It eats you, starting with your bottom. I've got four brothers, none of them Democrats. Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. No need, little lady, your tears of gratitude are enough for me.</p>

<p>Risk the pain, it is your nature. Oh my god! Did it sing? Easy as really difficult pie. I dislike that Anya. She's newly human and strangely literal. Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher. One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality. See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like.
